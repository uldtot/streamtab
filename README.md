This is not yet ready for use.

## Purpose of this
I wanted a way to save the streaming services i use on a list and be able to click to open them, for me to be able to stream to my tv or projector easyly.
Then i found outi might want movies too. So i made a change to have it load all my movies on the same device onto a list, from where i can choose to stream them. 

## Features
* Export all streaming services
* Import data
* Remove all data ( Usefull on first setup to remove default streaming services)
* Import your movies on the current device into the site

This is not yet ready for use.

## Purpose of this
I wanted a way to save the streaming services i use on a list and be able to click to open them, for me to be able to stream to my tv or projector easyly and without having to turn on some 3rd device that uses a lot of power to watch something. I opted for a reaspberyrpi and have this index.html saved omn the device.

I made this with HTML, JS and jQuery to make sure it worked on all devices. I am trying to make this work on my Raspberry pi Zero W

# duckchannel
Live demo here: https://websitecareio.github.io/streamtab/
The demo is the actual code from the index.html file, you can use it as your streamtab if you want or download the files and hosted it yourself.

## Why a duck
The question "Why a duck?" invites us to consider the various ways in which ducks (and other things) can be meaningful or significant, and to think about the underlying reasons for this significance... or simply put... Why not a duck.

## Purpose of this
I do not have a TV, instead i use a projector to watch content and i wanted a way to select what i wanted to watch without having to turn on my pc every time. My solution was to use a Raspberry Pi Zero W loaded with "Duck Streamtab" and the content it then sent to the projector.

A notes section have been added becaccuse i swtich streaming services all the time and cannot remember what episode i stopped at, and not all services remember what i have watched. Now i can just write where i was.

Images:
There are some images for streaming services made, but you will need to get your own permissions to use them. You can use any image if you want, just by entering a different URL.
